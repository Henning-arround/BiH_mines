    <svg>: This is the root container for SVG documents. It defines the space for the graphic, and all other SVG elements must be nested within this tag. Attributes of the <svg> tag can define dimensions, such as width and height, and also set properties like the viewport.

    <g>: This tag stands for "group" and is used to group multiple SVG elements together. Grouping elements allows you to apply transformations, styles, or events to multiple elements at once, rather than individually.

    <path>: This tag is one of the most powerful SVG elements, used to define complex shapes and curves. It uses a series of commands and coordinates to outline drawings or to define the shape of the element.

    <defs>: The <defs> tag is used to define graphical objects that can be reused within the SVG document with a <use> element. Elements inside <defs> are not rendered directly; they must be referenced by other SVG elements to become visible.

    <tspan>: This tag is used within <text> elements to style or position sections of text differently from the surrounding text. It allows fine control over the text layout and styling within larger text blocks.

    <image>: This element embeds a raster image into an SVG document, similar to the <img> element in HTML. You can use attributes to control the position, size, and aspect ratio of the embedded image.

    <text>: This tag is used to add text to SVG graphics. The <text> element supports styling, positioning, and can contain plain text or richer formatting through nested <tspan> elements.

    <clipPath>: The <clipPath> element defines a clipping path, which is a region of an SVG that "clips" or masks other parts of the SVG. Only the parts of the elements inside the clipping path will be visible; everything outside the path will be invisible.

These elements together provide a versatile toolkit for creating detailed and interactive graphical representations directly in XML format, which are scalable and performant across different devices and resolutions. Whether you're designing complex illustrations, working on interactive web graphics, or even performing some types of data visualization, these SVG elements are fundamental to achieving those goals.
