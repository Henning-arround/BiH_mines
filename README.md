# BiH_mines

The map can be viewed on the following website: 
[https://henning-arround.github.io/BiH_mines/](https://henning-arround.github.io/BiH_mines/)

The mine events were extracted from the EUFORBIH PDFs:
[https://www.euforbih.org/index.php/bih-minefield-maps](https://www.euforbih.org/index.php/bih-minefield-maps)

First, the PDFs were converted into SVGs using Inkscape. The landmine-related events were then extracted from the SVGs as vector graphics with their coordinates. This extraction can be traced in the script ‘detect_elements.ipynb’.
